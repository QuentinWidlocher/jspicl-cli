# jspicl CLI

jspicl CLI is a command line tool that simplifies PICO-8 game development in JavaScript.

**Features:**

- Comes with its own set of build pipeline so you don't need one.
- JavaScript to PICO-8 Lua transpilation through [jspicl](https://github.com/AgronKabashi/jspicl).
- Treeshaking which prevents unused code from being included and increasing your token count.
- Allows a PNG file to be used as a spritesheet, no need to edit your assets in PICO-8 anymore. Use your image editor of choice.
- Live reloading of PICO-8 cartridge whenever code or spritesheet is updated. See your changes live!

**Future goals:**

- Importing audio files to be used as SFX or music.

## Installation

```Shell
npm install jspicl-cli -D
```

## Usage

In order to generate a cartridge you need to supply at least four mandatory options:

```Shell
jspicl-cli
  --input <entryfile.js>
  --output <outputFile.p8>
  --spritesheetImagePath <pathToSpriteSheetFile.png>
  --cartridgePath <pathToExistingCartridge.p8>
```

## Watch mode

The CLI will listen for changes when the `--watch` option is passed.

This applies for the spritesheet aswell. Simply save your image and your changes will be reloaded in PICO-8.

**NOTE:** Reloading the cartridge is currently only supported on MacOS.
